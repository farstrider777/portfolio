Hi I'm Josh, a frontend developer with a big heart, a creative spirit, and a
knack for solving problems. As an innovator and dreamer, I've been fascinated
by computers since I was a child. Driven by a persistent desire to make the world
a little bit better, I stive to use my skills to create practical solutions to
common problems and promote positivity.
  <br><br>
When I am not at the computer I like to spend my time playing guitar, growing or gathering wild food,
and gaming with my friends.

   <div class="card-text2">A fun game project that I made one weekend and then refactored later. This project was started with a series of tests
     that directed the initial creation of objects and classes.
     <p> The game lets programmers
     take out their frustration on programming bugs. Based on the game whack-a-mole, whack-a-bug gets progressively
     harder each level until the user beats the game or is given his pink slip.
